  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Changing your divorce order
continue button field: changing_divorce_order_intro
question: |
  Changing your Divorce order
subquestion: |
  When a court  issues an order, both spouses are required to follow it.  If you think there is a reason to change an order, you can ask the court to change it.
  
  Before you ask the court to change an order:
  
  * Make sure you read all your paperwork to understand what it says. It is important to understand that judges make decisions according to the law and previous decisions from the Alaska Supreme Court.
  * Be aware that just because you do not like the outcome does not mean the judge made a mistake.
  * Also be aware that there are deadlines to take most actions and if you do not file the right document in time, you may be unable to file it.

      You have different ways to ask the court to change your child support order when your situation changes.  It can depend on when the court sent you the order.
  
      For the first 10 days after {the court sent the order to you}, you can file a **Motion to Reconsider**.  It asks the trial judge to fix something they overlooked or misunderstood.
       
        After 10 days, you can file a **Motion to Modify**.
       
        Your Action Plan will not include information about options that do not apply in your case.

          Generally, the courts only change spousal support if there is a "substantial change of circumstances".  Some examples are:
          Spouse A was ordered to pay Spouse B spousal support.  Spouse B was very ill and could not work.  Spouse B is now better and has a full-time job.
          Spouse A was ordered to pay Spouse B spousal support for 4 years so Spouse B could get a degree that would help them earn more money.  Spouse B got their degree in 3 years and now has a full-time job earning more money because of the degree.

  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
      Changing your divorce order is called “modifying” it.  The rules are different for changing spousal support and the property and debt division.      
       % if type_of_final_order['spousal support']:
       
      **Change Spousal Support**
      
      The courts will generally only change spousal support if there is a substantial change of circumstances.  Some examples are:
     
      * Spouse A was ordered to pay Spouse B spousal support.  Spouse B was very ill and could not work.  Spouse B is now better and has a full-time job.
      * Spouse A was ordered to pay Spouse B spousal support for 4 years so Spouse B could get a degree that would help them earn more money.  Spouse B got their degree in 3 years and not has a full-time job earning more money because of the degree.
      % endif
      % if type_of_final_order['property or debt']:
      
      **Change the Property and Debt Division**
     
      Changing the outcome of final property and debt decisions in a divorce case can be really tough. Once the court decides who gets what, it's not easy to undo those decisions. For instance, if the court gives one spouse the house, they might sell it, and then it's impossible to get it back if the other spouse later wants the court to award them the house.  Another example is when the court orders one person to receive some money from the marriage. If they spend that money, it can't be taken back later.

      Most of the time, custody, parenting plan, dividing property and debt, and spousal support are all in 1 order. The date the court sent the order to you is at the bottom of the last page. 
      
      Sometimes, the judge makes these orders at different times. 
      
      If you want to change orders with different dates, it can be complicated to know which date to use. You may want to talk to a lawyer or contact the [Family Law Self Help Center](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcabout.htm#hours) for help.
