Scenario: Row #77b
  Given I start the interview at "changing_divorce_order.yml"
    And I get to the question id "final screen" with this data:
    | var                                     | value                | trigger | 
    | user_need                               | change divorce order |         | 
    | middle_of_case                          | no                   |         | 
    | type_of_final_order['property or debt'] | True                 |         | 
    | why_change_divorce_order                | problem              |         | 
    | final_order_period                      | True                 |         | 
    | guess_final_order_date                  | more than 30 days    |         | 
    | parents_agree                           | False                |         |
